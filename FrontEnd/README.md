### Example .env content in backend folder:
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/uog_users
# JWT Secret Key (Keep this private!)
JWT_SECRET=YourKey

### Run the backend server:

cd frontend

### Install dependencies:
npm install



### Run the frontend
npm run dev

#### Frontend will be available at:

### 📂 Folder Overview
Folder	                         Description
backend/src/controllers	         Contains all logic for handling routes and API requests
backend/src/routes	             Contains API route definitions for authentication.
backend/src/models	             Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections
frontend/src/pages	             All main pages like Home, Dashboard, and ContactUs
frontend/src/components	         Reusable UI components such as Header, Footer ,Chatbot etc.

### How It Works

### Authentication Flow
- Users can Sign Up with full validation (name, email, password).
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before saving to MongoDB.
- On Sign In, a JWT token is generated and stored in sessionStorage.

### Future Improvements
The services section still needs some modifications for proper data display and a more user-friendly experience.
A Forgot Password feature will be added soon for better user access.
